# target-checkout-bot
Fully request based auto checkout bot to purchases items on target.com. The only bot that bypasses target security (Shape) anti-bot measures without the need for genning cookies before hand. Bot is currently in private but feel free to reach out for collaboration
for other modules. Target module is done, looking to expand on Walmart (PX), Macys, Costco, and other sites to be added.

This bot will be released and launched towards end of May.
