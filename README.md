# target-checkout-bot
Fully request based auto checkout bot to purchases items on target.com such as pokemon cards and nintendo switches. The only bot that bypasses target security (Shape) anti-bot measures without the need for genning cookies before hand (make cookies on the fly). Bot is currently in private but feel free to reach out for collaboration
for other modules. Target module is done, Pokemon center is done, Macys (testing), Costco (about 40% finished), and other sites to be added.

LAUNCHING NEXT WEEK, JULY 14TH MacOS/Windows/ARM support.
